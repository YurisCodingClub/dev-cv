# How to contribute

At the moment, all the information on how to contribute is stored in the ![README.md](https://github.com/YurisCodingClub/dev-cv/blob/main/README.md) 
file and in ![the project's wiki](https://github.com/YurisCodingClub/dev-cv/wiki).

After the project is in an advanced state, the documentation will be changed (as part of a contribution for beginners).
